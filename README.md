## Waybar config

This repo contains my current config for waybar which is as simple as beautiful (at least for me).

### Installation

This config contains some variables which must be substituted with help of Makefile and `make.conf`.

By default it's configured for sway and alacritty as terminal emulator, but you can simply change this in the config file by changing variable values.

```sh
    make
```

## What's next
